## Live Example Demonstration

[itch.io - godot-health-hitbox-hurtbox-hitscan](https://cluttered-code.itch.io/godot-health-hitbox-hurtbox-hitscan)

## Installation

### Asset Library Installation

1. Open the `AssetLib` tab in the Godot Editor.
2. Search for `Health`, `HitBox`, or `HurtBox` in the search bar.
3. Click the download button next to the Health, HitBoxes, and HurtBoxes plugin.
4. Once the installation is complete, go to `Project` -> `Project Settings` -> `Plugins`.
5. Find the `Health, HitBoxes, and HurtBoxes` plugin in the list and check the box to enable it.

## Usage

![Player Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cluttered-code/godot-health-hitbox-hurtbox/refs/heads/main/images/character_structure.png "CharacterBody2D Structure")

1. Add a `Health` node to a Node that needs health (ie. `CharacterBody2D` or `StaticBody3D`)
2. Add a `HurtBox2D` node with a `CollisionShape2D` to the same Node.
3. Set the `HurtBox2D` collision layer.
4. `HitBox2D` or `HitScan2D`
	- Create a projectile or melee weapon with a `HitBox2D` and set the collision mask to the same layer as the `HurtBox2D` collision layer. This will automatically apply damage and healing.
	- Create a gun with a `HitScan2D` extending from the barrel and set the collision mask to the same layer as the `HurtBox2D` collision layer. `fire()` needs to be called on the `HitScan2D` to apply damage and healing.
